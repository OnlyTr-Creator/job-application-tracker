## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find application to update"
**Cause**: Company Name or Job Title doesn't match exactly

**Solution:**
1. Export data to see exact names
2. Copy-paste from CSV
3. Watch for: extra spaces, caps, punctuation

### "Success Score seems wrong"
**Cause**: Score factors in time passed

**Solution:**
- Recent applications: Score is accurate
- Old applications: Score decreases over time (this is intentional!)
- To see original score: Update status to re-calculate

### "Calendar events not creating"
**Cause**: Google Calendar not authorized

**Solution:**
1. CREAO will prompt for authorization
2. Follow OAuth flow
3. Grant calendar access
4. Try again

### "Dashboard shows 0 applications"
**Cause**: CSV file empty or corrupted

**Solution:**
1. Export data
2. Check job_applications.csv exists
3. Make sure you've added at least one application

### "AI suggestions not helpful"
**Cause**: Not enough data yet

**Solution:**
- Add at least 5 applications for meaningful insights
- Update statuses regularly
- Track for at least 2 weeks before analyzing patterns
